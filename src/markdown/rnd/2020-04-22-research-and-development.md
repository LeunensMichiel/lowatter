A test setup was designed and built for research and development. This test setup resembles a residential hot water system.

The distribution system is a circulation pipe. The test setup is designed in such a way that the production unit can be easily replaced. Tests are currently being carried out with an electric boiler and heat pump boiler. In the future, we will also provide a heat pump boiler connected to solar collectors. This allows testing different system configurations with these components.

The test setup contains Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, which allows us to test and optimize the effectiveness of anti-Legionella products before introducing them to the market.
