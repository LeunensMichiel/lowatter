  - question: How does Legionella enter the building?
    answer: Legionella is naturally present in lakes, rivers and also in our tap
      water. The bacterium enters the building at a very low harmless
      concentration. However, in buildings there are situations that are optimal
      for the growth of the bacteria, such as ideal temperatures between 20 and
      45째C or standing water. In this way dangerous concentrations can be
      achieved in buildings.
  - answer: At home there are 2 things to look out for. First and foremost, the
      boiler temperature must be set at 60째C. At a temperature of 60째C, it takes
      5 minutes to kill 90% of the Legionella bacteria present. Secondly, you
      should let the cold and warm water run for a few minutes at infrequently
      used taps if you started using these taps. Do the same when returning from
      a vacation.
    question: What can you do at home?
  - answer: When you return home after a holiday of more than a week, it is best to
      flush your pipes. This for both cold and hot water pipes. Put your tap on
      the hottest setting to flush the hot water pipes. If the water from the
      tap is hot, let the water flow for at least a minute to remove the
      standing water. At a temperature of 60째C it takes 5 minutes to kill 90% of
      the Legionella bacteria present. You should ventilate the room while doing
      this.
    question: Do you have to take measures at home after a holiday?
  - answer: A humidifier with evaporation does not pose a risk because there is no
      aerosol development due to water atomization. However, humidifiers with
      atomization do pose a certain risk, especially when the water in the water
      reservoir heats up due to, for example, the sun.
    question: Can Legionella also occur in a humidifier?
  - answer: No, the water in heating installations is in a closed circuit.
      Legionella bacteria do not have enough oxygen and nutrients to survive for
      a longer time.
    question: Can you get sick from venting a heating system, as this also releases
      aerosols?
