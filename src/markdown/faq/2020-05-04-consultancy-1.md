  - question: How does Legionella enter the building?
    answer: Legionella is naturally present in lakes, rivers and also in our tap
      water. The bacterium enters the building at a very low harmless
      concentration. However, in buildings there are situations that are optimal
      for the growth of the bacteria, such as ideal temperatures between 20 and
      45°C or standing water. In this way dangerous concentrations can be
      achieved in buildings.
  - answer: At home there are 2 things to look out for. First and foremost, the
      boiler temperature must be set at 60°C. At a temperature of 60°C, it takes
      5 minutes to kill 90% of the Legionella bacteria present. Secondly, you
      should let the cold and warm water run for a few minutes at infrequently
      used taps if you started using these taps. Do the same when returning from
      a vacation.
