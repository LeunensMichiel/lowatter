  - answer: Daily research is carried out at UGent to gain better understanding in
      Legionella risks. Measuring Legionella is a very labor and time intensive
      process, resulting in the development of a simulation model that allows to
      predict Legionella contamination risk in a building. In this way, the
      cause of the contamination can be quickly determined in a contaminated
      building.
    question: Legionella research, why does LoWatter work with a simulation model?
  - answer: To be Legionella safe, we have to produce water at 60°C, while we only
      use temperatures around 40°C at our taps. This hinders the use of
      energy-efficient production systems (such as heat pumps) for the
      production of hot water. Producing water at those high temperatures
      therefore entails a lot of extra energy use, in contrast to the demand
      from consumers to work at a lower temperature. Ghent University is
      conducting research to provide a solution to these continuously high
      temperatures, so that energy can be saved without endangering human
      health.
    question: Isn't producing water at 60°C very energy consuming?
