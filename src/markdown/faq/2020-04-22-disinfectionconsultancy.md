  - question: What is Legionella?
    answer: "Legionella pneumophila is an aerobic gram-negative bacterium. 39
      different species of Legionella have been identified. The most common
      Legionella species is Legionella pneumophila. Legionella pneumophila
      species appear in most natural water supplies like lakes, ponds and rivers
      in low concentration and in dormant stage. But Legionella bacteria from
      natural habitats can be increased remarkably in man-made hot water systems
      where the temperature is optimal for their growth and can reach a
      dangerous concentration. Therefore, to obtain more energy efficient and
      healthy domestic hot water systems, it is necessary to look at the
      interactions between Legionella pneumophila bacteria and the domestic hot
      water system. "
  - question: When is Legionella discovered?
    answer: The Legionella bacterium delivers its name from an outbreak at the
      American Legion’s Convention at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in
      Philadelphia in July 1976. 221 American Legion Members were struck with
      severe pneumonia, of whom 34 died. This form of pneumonia was called
      Legionnaires’ Disease and when the bacterium causing it was finally
      identified, it was termed Legionella. It was not the first outbreak. It is
      known from stored tissue that this bacterium was responsible for mystery
      illnesses 50 years ago. Prior to 1976 there had been an outbreak in the
      St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington DC where 81 patients became ill, 14
      of whom died. Another outbreak in the same Bellevue Stratford Hotel in
      Philadelphia was in 1974 at an Oddfellows Convention where 20 attendees
      got ill, two of whom died.
  - answer: Legionella appears in the media occasionally, this does not happen
      often. Fire and CO poisoning are well known as causes of building related
      deaths. But, more people die each year from Legionella infection than from
      CO poisoning. A Legionella infection often goes unnoticed, as it can
      manifest as a mild flu or serious pneumonia. As a result, the cause is
      often not detected, so the registered number of Legionella infections
      remains low. However, a urine test can confirm a Legionella infection.
    question: How common is a Legionella infection?
  - answer: A big misunderstanding is that you get a Legionella infection by
      drinking contaminated water. This is not true. Legionella bacteria cannot
      survive in the human stomach. Drinking tap water therefore does not
      present any contamination risk. If that is the case, how do you get
      infected? Infection occurs by inhaling contaminated aerosols, aerosols are
      very small water droplets that are produced by, for example, a shower
      head. These drops are so small that they can enter the lungs. Please note
      that steam/vapor cannot contain Legionella bacteria as these drops are too
      small to carry bacteria.
    question: How do you get infected?
  - answer: >-
      Legionella pneumophila is the most dangerous Legionella species for
      humans, it is able to induce two kinds of illnesses that appear two to ten
      days after exposure.

      One is Legionnaires’ Disease, a life threatening pneumonia against which the victim requires urgent medication. Symptoms of Legionellosis are a general ill feeling, headache, muscle pain, cough and shortness of breath, followed by pneumonia with a fever of over 39°C. Legionellosis must be treated with antibiotics, and even after the infection, the disease can have long-lasting consequences.

      The other disease caused by the species is Pontiac Fever, named after an outbreak in Pontiac, Michigan in 1968. This variant is an flue like acute respiratory disease. Having Pontiac fever, the patient will experience mild flu-like symptoms for 2 to 5 days, such as fever, muscle pain, headache and cough. The disease is not dangerous in this mild form, there is no pneumonia. The complaints can pass without treatment.

      It was only after 1976, after the outbreak in Philadelphia, where Legionella was discovered, that public health officials were able to ascertain that the same bacterium caused the previous outbreaks of Pontiac Fever.
