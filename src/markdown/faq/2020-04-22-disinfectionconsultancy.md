  - question: What is Legionella?
    answer: "Legionella pneumophila is an aerobic gram-negative bacterium. 39
      different species of Legionella have been identified. The most common
      Legionella species is Legionella pneumophila. Legionella pneumophila
      species appear in most natural water supplies like lakes, ponds and rivers
      in low concentration and in dormant stage. But Legionella bacteria from
      natural habitats can be increased remarkably in man-made hot water systems
      where the temperature is optimal for their growth and can reach a
      dangerous concentration. Therefore, to obtain more energy efficient and
      healthy domestic hot water systems, it is necessary to look at the
      interactions between Legionella pneumophila bacteria and the domestic hot
      water system. "
  - question: When is Legionella discovered?
    answer: The Legionella bacterium delivers its name from an outbreak at the
      American Legion’s Convention at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in
      Philadelphia in July 1976. 221 American Legion Members were struck with
      severe pneumonia, of whom 34 died. This form of pneumonia was called
      Legionnaires’ Disease and when the bacterium causing it was finally
      identified, it was termed Legionella. It was not the first outbreak. It is
      known from stored tissue that this bacterium was responsible for mystery
      illnesses 50 years ago. Prior to 1976 there had been an outbreak in the
      St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington DC where 81 patients became ill, 14
      of whom died. Another outbreak in the same Bellevue Stratford Hotel in
      Philadelphia was in 1974 at an Oddfellows Convention where 20 attendees
      got ill, two of whom died.
  - answer: Legionella appears in the media occasionally, this does not happen
      often. Fire and CO poisoning are well known as causes of building related
      deaths. But, more people die each year from Legionella infection than from
      CO poisoning. A Legionella infection often goes unnoticed, as it can
      manifest as a mild flu or serious pneumonia. As a result, the cause is
      often not detected, so the registered number of Legionella infections
      remains low. However, a urine test can confirm a Legionella infection.
    question: How common is a Legionella infection?
  - answer: A big misunderstanding is that you get a Legionella infection by
      drinking contaminated water. This is not true. Legionella bacteria cannot
      survive in a human stomach. Drinking tap water therefore does not present
      any risk of contamination. How do you get infected? Contamination occurs
      by inhaling contaminated aerosols, aerosols are very small water droplets
      that are produced by, for example, a shower head. These drops are so small
      that they can enter the lungs. Please note, steam / vapor cannot contain
      Legionella bacteria as these drops are too small to carry the bacteria.
