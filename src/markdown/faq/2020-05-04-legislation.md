  - question: What is BBT (2017)?
    answer: >-
      BBT is the Best Available Techniques for Legionella Control manual. This
      manual describes the technical guidelines for Legionella control to which
      a sanitary installation is deemed to conform. The guidelines in this
      manual are seen as the code of good practice.

      The Agency Zorg en Gezondheid uses this manual as a reference document when exercising its supervisory function regarding compliance with the Flemish Legionella Decree of May 4 2007.

  - question: What alternative measures for Legionella control are allowed?
    answer: In addition to the standard measure of temperature control (60°C
      departure, 55°C return), alternative control measures are also possible.
      Those measures must be approved by the minister. There are currently 7
      approved systems (Ecodis® cell, Oxiperm®Pro, BIFIPRO®, Huwa-San
      Controller®, Aqualitybox®, Bello Zon®, EasyDis®). For each system, a
      ministerial decree containing a brief description of the device and the
      use conditions has been drawn up after a trial phase has been completed
      and after the advice from the Superior Health Council.
