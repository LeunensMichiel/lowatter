title: Decontamination consultancy
description: Do you have a Legionella problem? We solve it structurally and
  sustainably. We draw up a case-specific simulation model, with which we first
  “virtually” test the effectiveness of possible solutions (modifications to the
  system design, decontamination techniques) on a contaminated system, before
  applying this in practice.
