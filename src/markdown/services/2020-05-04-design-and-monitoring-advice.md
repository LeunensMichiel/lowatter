title: Design and monitoring advice
description: We provide advice during the design, renovation and/or
  commissioning phase. The consultancy is aimed at building owners and property
  managers and will advise them on how to design, improve and/or replace their
  current installation legionella-safe. We are drawing up a case-specific
  simulation model, with which the contamination risk can be investigated
  preventively during the design phase. We also have a lot of experience in the
  field of monitoring and offer you support on that part as well.
