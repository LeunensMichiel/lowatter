The energy required for the production of hot water dominates the total energy demand in well-insulated buildings. The production temperature for collective hot water systems was set by law in Flanders at 60Â°C to prevent bacterial growth. It is possible to reduce the energy use for hot water by switching to low temperature hot water systems. Currently, however, this is prohibited in a large number of buildings in Flanders and in Europe, due to the health risks.

By using a simulation model developed by the Building Physics research group, bacterial growth in a hot water system can be estimated. This means that lowering the production temperature in combination with heat shocks, controlled by our **smart hot water controller**, may be interesting in the future.

A **test setup** was built to test and investigate the operation of the smart hot water controller. If the effect is demonstrated, an attempt can be made to have this new product approved as an alternative Legionella control measure in Flanders. In this way, a lot of energy can be saved without endangering the health of the resident.
