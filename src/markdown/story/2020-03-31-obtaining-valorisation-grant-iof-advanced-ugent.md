The valorisation of Elisa Van Kenhove's PhD is partly carried out in the form of an IOF Advanced mandate (UGent, start November 2018). This grant focuses on the development of the smart hot water controller. The aim is to design a prototype of the controller with the knowledge gained in the PhD. This controller controls the domestic hot water production temperature and stores this water at a lower temperature, i.e. a comfort temperature of ± 45°C, combined with heat shocks once the control algorithm reached the predetermined Legionella pneumophila concentration limit. Depending on the target market, there are two types of the controller:

(1) integrated controller in the production unit (target market: residential buildings)

(2) stand-alone controller (target market: large/public buildings).
