This week, the controller was tested in the test setup for the first time. We are happy to announce that the first tests look promising. The controller succeeds in properly predicting the total bacterial count in the hot water system.

The smart hot water controller will still need to go through a lot of additional tests and research. If it's correct use is demonstrated, an attempt can be made to have this new product approved as an alternative Legionella control measure in Flanders. In this way, a lot of energy can be saved without endangering the health of the resident.
