We provide advice during the design, renovation and/or commissioning phase of a sanitary hot water system. The consultancy is aimed at building owners and property managers and will advise them on how to safely design, improve and/or replace their installation. We will also propose more energy-efficient and sustainable solutions for a specific case, without increasing the risk of a Legionella infection.

We also have a lot of experience in monitoring domestic hot water systems. This includes mapping temperatures, flow rates and energy losses through the entire system. For example, we can advise you on which measuring devices you can additionally purchase to check the weak points in your installation and assist in the design of a fully automated management system.
