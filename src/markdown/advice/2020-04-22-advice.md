We provide advice during the design, renovation and/or commissioning phase of a sanitary hot water system. The consultancy is aimed at building owners and property managers and will advise them on how to safely design, improve and/or replace their current installation. We will also propose more energy-efficient and sustainable solutions for a specific case, without increasing the risk of a Legionella infection.

We also have a lot of experience in the field of monitoring, and can offer you support on that part as well.
