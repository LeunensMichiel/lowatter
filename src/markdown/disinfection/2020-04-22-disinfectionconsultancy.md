steps:
  - steptitle: Notification of Legionella problem
    description: In the first step, we receive a notification from the customer of a
      Legionella problem. This report will be treated discreetly.

  - steptitle: Study the hydraulic scheme
    description: Then, we will study the sanitary hot water system on the basis of
      the hydraulic scheme. Questions and ambiguities are listed here.

  - steptitle: Site visit
    description: During the 3rd step, we go on a site visit. Hereby, the questions
      that remained after studying the hydraulic scheme are answered.

  - steptitle: Perform additional measurements
    description: If necessary or desired, we can perform additional measurements.
      This can range from measurements of temperatures, flow rates to Legionella
      concentrations.

  - steptitle: Compiling a simulation model
    description: >-
      With the help of our disinfection tool, the case-specific simulation model
      is built and calculated within 24 hours after obtaining the necessary data
      (hydraulic schedule and site visit). Our case-specific simulation model
      allows us to identify the causes of the infection in existing infected
      buildings, and to choose suitable disinfection measures for the infected
      system.


      A case-specific simulation model can be compiled for any building with a hot water demand, such as sports complexes, hotels, residential care centers and hospitals.

  - steptitle: Calculate variants in terms of renovation measures and/or controls
    description: >-
      The entire hot water system of your building is dynamically simulated,
      which makes it possible to predict the temperatures and Legionella
      concentrations throughout the system at any time. For example, the
      infection risk associated with a particular part of the installation can
      be assessed, temperature regimes can be optimized and the risk of
      infection can be reduced. In addition, the simulation model can also be
      used to propose energy saving strategies.


      Now that the simulation model has been drawn up, we can test the effectiveness of various renovation measures and/or controls "virtually" before implementing these measures in practice (e.g. insulating certain pipes, adjusting flow rates of certain circuits, etc.).

  - steptitle: Advice on the most effective measure(s)
    description: Based on this, we provide advice on which case-specific measure(s)
      will ensure that the infection disappears and does not recur. The measures
      we propose are sustainable and effective on the long-term. Important
      parameters here are health, energy use, water use and/or cost.

  - steptitle: Support during implementation
    description: The customer chooses which measure is most feasible for him, we
      offer support during the implementation of this/these measure(s).
