    "services.description": "LoWatter provides case-specific knowledge through consultancy on disinfection or energy savings with a Legionella pneumophila predictive simulation model to reduce energy use, costs and infection risk during the production, storage and distribution of domestic hot water. \n\n\n Our consultancy approach follows the following steps: \n \n STEP 1. Notification of Legionella problem\n \n STEP 2. Study hydraulic scheme\n \n STEP 3. Site visit\n \n STEP 4. Perform additional measurements (of temperatures, flow rates, Legionella concentrations) \n \n STEP 5. Compile a simulation model of the hot water system \n \n STEP 6. Calculate variants of system renovation or control \n \n STEP 7. Advice on the most effective variant (in terms of health, energy and water use, costs) \n \n STEP 8. Support during implementation",
